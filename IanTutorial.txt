type it! 
Each div has a discription of what should be in  it. And I want to add what things it will have thtat are clickable. etc. 
each div will be full page with sub divs etc. as needed. Does that make sense?

javascript file or maybe files with a library file. 


.css file


variables:
//global to the app
???
//saved between sessions
???
  
  

functions:
//data functions
getData() // retrieve data from local storage or return null if it doesn't exist
setData() // put data file onto the local storage
//view functions
displayIndex() // will show "number of days" if getData() returns data, or "create habit" if null
displayFAQ() // asynchronously load external html page or a json file
displayCreateHabit() //
displayReward()
displayFinished()
displaySorry()
displayPage(whichPage) //generic page view function
whichPage is a variable that would be used to view/hide for each div view. 


//controller functions
//these functions may alter the data, which means the new data needs to be stored again
//they may also call a view function
newHabitButtonClicked()
finishButtonClicked()
resetClicked()
BeginClicked()
yesNoClicked()
//helper functions or app functions
getDate()
//logic function
finishedWithHabit() // returns true or false


//delegator function, or "executive" function
//a delegator function is a master controller; it calls other functions based on logic
if (finishedWithHabit()){
  displayFinished()
} else {
  displayNotFinished(){
  
}
